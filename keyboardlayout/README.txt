I am using the Neo2 keyboard layout designed for German. This layout was
influenced by Dvorak for Enlish.

But I want to change Neo2 a bit. I am using (some variations of) Ubuntu. So I
copied the file /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/de to this folder.

After I make my changes I want to replace my custom "de" file with the real
one.

The image neo_Ebene_4.svg I got from http://neo-layout.org/grafik/tastatur2d/
