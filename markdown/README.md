## Github Flavored Markdown
This is the file where I test Github Flavored Markdown (GFM).
### Next smaller Title
This is awesome.
This is another line.

This is a code block:

```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
  cout << "hello worlds!";
  return 0;
}
```

And the following text is a blockquote:

This word is *italic* and this one is **bold**. And this one is ***bold and italic***.

There are two possibilities to write lists:

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3

and

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3*

Also there are ordered lists:
1. First Item
2. Second Item

and nested lists:
1. First main Item
  1. First nested Item
  2. Second nested Item
2. Second main Item
  * Another nested Item
  * Second another nested item

The following `inline format` can be used for `code? maybe ${var/bla/blub}`

And of course there are Task lists:
- [ ] Call your mother.
- [ ] Buy some food.
- [x] Find the meaning of life.

This text ~~is crossed out~~.

Now let's try to make a table:

First Header | Second Header
-------      | ----------
Cell 1       | Cell 2         | Cell 3
Cell 1       | Cell 2         | Cell 3
Cell 1       | Cell 2         | Cell 3
