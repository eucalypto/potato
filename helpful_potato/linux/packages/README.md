Linux Packages
==============

One of the greatest advantages of modern linux distributions are their
package repositories. Whenever possible, you should install a program
(package) form  a well-maintained repository.

Your program may not be in the standard repository of your OS but in
another one. To find your package this website is super useful:
> http://pkgs.org/

Here you can find out which distro offers a package from which
repository -- Very useful indeed!
