I have put the keymap file into this repository to keep track of my custom
shortcuts. It is the "keymap.cson" file. In '.atom/' I made a soft link to this
file here.

My Settings:
  "Editor Settings":
    * Auto Indent (checked)
    * Scroll Past End (checked)
    * Show Invisibles (checked)
    * Schow Line Numbers (checked)
    * Soft Tabs (checked) // with this the editor inserts whitespaces instead
                          // of tabs
    * Soft Wrap (checked)
